iucode-tool (2.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Move source and binary from contrib/utils to utils:
    + Demote intel-microcode from Recommends to Suggests, since
      intel-microcode already depends on it the other way around.
    + Following the 2022 General Resolution about non-free firmware,
      intel-microcode is moving to non-free-firmware. Having iucode-tool
      in main makes it possible to have intel-microcode deployed on systems
      set up with only main and non-free-firmware.

iucode-tool (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    + The early initramfs cpio archives created by iucode_tool are now
      deterministic.  Instead of the current system time, the date of
      the latest microcode included in the early initramfs will be used.
    + There is a new option to minimize the size of the early initramfs:
      --mini-earlyfw.  This option causes iucode_tool to create a non-
      standard cpio archive which is typically 736 bytes smaller.
      WARNING: the microcode data file might not be visible to the
      regular initramfs when this mode is used.
    + iucode-tool will now create valid early initramfs archives past
      year 2038.
    + Change the strategy to add defensive padding to the early-initramfs
      archive: add an empty directory entry to the cpio archive in order
      to force the correct 16-byte alignment for the microcode data by
      default.  For --mini-earlyfs, keep the old strategy of appending
      extra NULs to the end of the microcode data file name.
  * debian/control: correct build-depends versioning of autoconf, automake.
    Correct the minimum required versions of autoconf and automake, which
    were bumped by upstream version 2.0.
  * debian/compat, rules, control: modernize and enable full hardening
    + update debian/rules copyright date
    + switch to dh-based simplified debian/rules (debhelper v9)
    + opt-in to full hardening for PIE and bindnow
    As a side-effect, we now fully honor DEB_*_STRIP, etc.
  * debian/watch: add uscan watch file.
    Add a debian/watch uscan version 3 watchfile to automatically check the
    newest iucode-tool release tarball version, using the "latest" branch of
    the iucode/releases gitlab project.
  * debian/changelog: fix typos on older entires.
  * debian/copyright: switch to DEP-5 format.

iucode-tool (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + This new major version has several non-backwards-compatible
      changes.  Scripts that scrape iucode_tool's stdout/stderr messages
      might have to be updated, and the behavior for -s and -S options
      changed.
      + The microcode listing output format used by --list and
        --list-all changed: the processor flags mask field is now
        labeled "pf_mask" instead of "pf mask", and the first field
        (bundle id/microcode id) is wider for --list-all, and completely
        changed for --list (refer to next entry).
      + The output for the --list option now uses the same microcode
        numbering used in --list-all and error messages, and also the
        same indentation as --list-all.  For this reason, --list will
        output the bundle assignment list to stdout when not in --quiet
        mode, the same way --list-all does.
      + The --scan-system/-S option can now only be specified once, and
        it may be overridden by -s !<signature> options that come
        +after* it in command line ordering.  To emulate the previous
        behavior, always specify --scan-system just once, and as the
        last option (i.e. after any -s options).
      + Error and warning messages, as well as some verbose (and debug)
        messages were updated, and some of them were demoted to higher
        verbosity levels.
    + Other relevant changes since v1.6.1:
      + Microcodes are now sorted by signature (ascending) and processor
        flags mask (descending).  Before, microcodes with the same
        signature but different processor flags mask had unspecified
        ordering.
      + The .dat format loader was optimized to run a lot faster on
        files that match the Intel layout exactly, and improved its
        error detection.
      + iucode_tool now flushes output data files to permanent storage
        using fdatasync() before closing them, to better detect write
        errors.  This causes a performance hit, but it is much safer.
      + Fix large file support (LFS) on 32-bit builds.
      + Abort with an error when attempting to write more than 4GiB to a
        cpio (early initramfs) archive, due to a limitation of that cpio
        file format.

iucode-tool (1.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    + iucode_tool: append microcode bundles to linked list in O(1)
    + iucode_tool: stop allocating twice the required memory for a bundle
    + iucode_tool: don't close input files twice
      load_intel_microcode() would cause fds to be closed twice. iucode_tool
      is not multi-threaded and isn't otherwise affected by this bug, but
      unfortunately there is a free() call between the first and second
      close().  When running iucode_tool under some sort of malloc
      instrumentation insane enough to open file descriptors on free()
      inside the instrumented process' context, or indirectly linked to a
      multi-threaded glibc module/plugin that could do the same, bad things
      could happen.
    + iucode_tool(8): update Linux notes for up to v4.6

iucode-tool (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + There is a new option to write out microcodes, capable of writing
      out every revision of every microcode: --write-all-named-to.  All
      other write out options will only output a single revision of a
      microcode
    + iucode_tool(8): fix parameter name of --write-named-to.

iucode-tool (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Implement a microcode recover mode (-tr) for the binary loader,
      which searches for valid microcode(s) inside a generic (binary)
      data file of unknown format
    + Report empty data files using ENOENT instead of EINVAL in the
      low-level loader functions.  This is can happen to non-empty files
      in the -tr and -td loaders, as well as when reading an empty file
      from stdin, FIFO, pipe, character device, etc.
    + Notify the user when we fail to find any microcode in a data file
      when the low-level loader returns ENOENT, and continue processing
      in that case
    + In -vv mode, print a message before reading a file, and also when
      skipping empty files or reading a directory
    + Fix spelling of default-firmware-dir option in configure,
      thanks to Timo Gurr for the report and fix
    + Replace "deselect" with "unselect" in the manpage text

iucode-tool (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Make it safe to call iucode_tool with stdout and/or stderr closed
    + Ignore multiple attempts to read microcode data from stdin, as all
      data will have been read by the first attempt
    + Document in the manpage the arbitrary maximum limit of 1GiB worth of
      binary data per microcode data file.  The other limits are too large
      to bother documenting
    + Microcode data file loader fixes and enhancements:
      + Improve IO error detection
      + Print the line number when reporting .dat parsing errors
      + Allow comments after valid data for .dat files, previously they
        had to be on a line of their own
      + Rework the .dat parser to make it less convoluted, and optimize it
        for the exact .dat file layout Intel has been using in the last 15
        years
    + Minor build fixes

iucode-tool (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Fix issues found by the Coverity static checker:
    + CID 72165: An off-by-one error caused an out-of-bounds write to a
      buffer while loading large microcode data files in ascii format
    + CID 72163: The code could attempt to close an already closed file
      descriptor in certain conditions when processing directories
    + CID 72161: Stop memory leak in error path when loading microcode
      data files
    + CID 72159, 72164, 72166, 72167, 72168, 72169: Cosmetic issues

iucode-tool (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Don't output duplicates for microcodes with extended signatures
      to the same file or to the kernel
    + When writing an early initramfs, pad its trailer with zeros to
      the next 1024-byte boundary.  This is done so that the next
      initramfs segment will be better aligned, just in case.  The
      entire cpio medatada overhead is now exactly 1024 bytes
    + Manpage style fixes: use iucode_tool consistently, groff formatting
    + Refuse to load ridiculously large data files (limit set to 1GiB)
  * debian/lintian-override: override hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
    as iucode-tool(8) now uses proper groff hyphens, but not in
    a way the lintian test can detect.
  * debian/rules: remove autoconf-1.14 autogenerated files on clean

iucode-tool (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    + Properly check microcode metadata date to be valid packed BCD in
      strict mode
    + Do not assume a non-zero microcode Total Size field to be valid, it
      is valid only when the Data Size field is non-zero.  Fortunately,
      Intel always set reserved fields to zero on released microcode, so
      this bug was never (and is unlikely to ever be) triggered
    + Linux kernel bug workaround: when generating the early initramfs
      archive, append NULs to the microcode data file name to pad the
      start of the microcode data inside the initramfs archive to a
      16-byte boundary.  Document this issue on the manpage, the
      workaround is only effective if the start of our early initramfs
      cpio segment is 16-byte aligned in the final initramfs archive
    + Fix several cosmetic and minor code issues
    + Manpage fixes and enhancements
  * debian/control: add debian/master branch information to Vcs-Git field

iucode-tool (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream maintenance release
    + Fix several cosmetic code issues
    + Manpage updates
      + Make it clear that the output order of microcodes is not stabilized
      + Make it clear that iucode_tool always break links when writing a
        data file, and that it doesn't replace files atomically, so they
        can get corrupted/lost if iucode-tool is interrupted while writing
      + Reword several notes for better readability
    + Use openat() when loading from a directory and when creating files in
      a directory.  Thus, iucode-tool will read/write to the same directory
      even while racing another process that is trying to rename it while
      iucode-tool is already running
